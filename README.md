# Exercises
 
## Exercises 10.1: Initializing the application

Initialize your application with Expo command-line interface and set up the development environment either using an emulator or Expo's mobile app. It is recommended to try both and find out which development environment is the most suitable for you. The name of the application is not that relevant. You can, for example, go with *rate-repository-app*.

To submit this exercise and all future exercises you need to [create a new GitHub repository](https://github.com/new). 
The name of the repository can be for example the name of the application you initialized with expo init. 
If you decide to create a private repository, add GitHub user [mluukkai](https://github.com/mluukkai) as a repository collaborator. 
The collaborator status is only used for verifying your submissions.

Now that the repository is created, run `git init` within your application's root directory to make sure that the directory is initialized as a Git repository. Next, to add the created repository as the remote run `git remote add origin git@github.com:<YOURGITHUBUSERNAME>/<NAMEOFYOUR_REPOSITORY>.git` (remember to replace the placeholder values in the command). Finally, just commit and push your changes into the repository, and you are all done.

## Exercise 10.2: Setting up the ESLint

Set up ESLint in your project so that you can perform linter checks by running `npm run lint`. To get most of linting it is also recommended to integrate ESLint with your editor.

This was the last exercise in this section. It's time to push your code to GitHub and mark all of your finished exercises to the [exercise submission system](https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/stats/courses/fs-react-native-2020). 
Note that exercises in this section should be submitted to part 1 in the exercise submission system.
